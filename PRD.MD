# PyMine - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Learning Python game development can be intimidating for beginners, with complex frameworks and overwhelming codebases creating barriers to entry. PyMine addresses this challenge by providing a colorful 2D sandbox game inspired by Minecraft and Super Mario, designed specifically as an educational tool.

The solution features an intentionally compact, extensively commented codebase split into pygame-free logic layers, enabling Python beginners to experiment and learn without digging through framework specifics. The game offers endless exploration, creative building, and relaxing gameplay through pastel themes and intuitive mechanics.

PyMine delivers value by democratizing game development education, providing a foundation that educators, Python beginners, and hobbyist developers can use to understand core game programming concepts. The target users include Python learners, programming educators, computer science students, and anyone seeking an accessible entry point into game development.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Player Movement and Navigation
**As a** player  
**I want** to move my character smoothly through the world using intuitive controls  
**So that** I can explore and navigate the game environment naturally  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player is in the game world  
- **When** they press WASD or arrow keys  
- **Then** the character moves left/right with responsive physics  
- **And** character collision prevents movement through solid blocks  
- **And** movement speed adapts appropriately when crouching  

### Story 2: Creative Block Building
**As a** creative player  
**I want** to place and remove blocks in the world  
**So that** I can build structures and modify the landscape  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player has blocks in their inventory  
- **When** they left-click within build range  
- **Then** a block is placed at the crosshair location  
- **When** they right-click on an existing block  
- **Then** the block is removed from the world  
- **And** building is restricted to a reasonable radius around the player  

### Story 3: Flight Mode for Advanced Building
**As a** builder  
**I want** to toggle flight mode for easier construction  
**So that** I can build tall structures and access hard-to-reach areas  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player is in normal mode  
- **When** they double-tap spacebar  
- **Then** flight mode activates with vertical movement controls  
- **And** gravity no longer affects the player  
- **When** toggled off, normal physics resume immediately  

### Story 4: Inventory Management
**As a** player  
**I want** to select different block types from my inventory  
**So that** I can build with variety and express creativity  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player has multiple block types available  
- **When** they press keys 1-5  
- **Then** the corresponding inventory slot is selected  
- **And** the selected block type is highlighted in the HUD  
- **And** the next placed block uses the selected type  

### Story 5: Infinite World Exploration
**As an** explorer  
**I want** to discover new areas as I travel  
**So that** I can experience endless adventure and find new building locations  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player moves beyond current world boundaries  
- **When** they enter unexplored territory  
- **Then** new terrain generates seamlessly  
- **And** both horizontal and vertical expansion occurs on demand  
- **And** generation maintains consistent visual and gameplay quality  

### Story 6: Visual Customization Through Themes
**As a** player seeking atmosphere  
**I want** to cycle through different color themes  
**So that** I can customize the visual experience to my preference  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player is in the game  
- **When** they press the T key  
- **Then** the entire visual theme changes to the next palette  
- **And** all blocks, UI elements, and backgrounds update accordingly  
- **And** theme changes maintain gameplay functionality  

### Story 7: Precise Building Control
**As a** detail-oriented builder  
**I want** precise block placement with visual feedback  
**So that** I can create accurate structures and detailed designs  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** the player moves the mouse over the world  
- **When** the cursor is within build range  
- **Then** a grid-snapped crosshair shows the target location  
- **And** placement respects collision with player and existing blocks  
- **And** visual feedback indicates valid placement zones  

### Story 8: Learning-Focused Codebase Navigation
**As a** Python beginner  
**I want** to understand and modify game mechanics easily  
**So that** I can learn game development concepts through hands-on experimentation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Given** a beginner examines the source code  
- **When** they explore the modular file structure  
- **Then** pygame logic is clearly separated from core game mechanics  
- **And** extensive comments explain the purpose of each system  
- **And** modifications can be made without breaking the game  

## Functional Requirements

### Player Physics and Movement
- Character responds to directional input with consistent acceleration and deceleration
- Gravity applies downward force when not in flight mode, with configurable terminal velocity
- Jumping provides initial upward velocity when player is grounded
- Crouching reduces movement speed and character height for precision control
- Collision detection prevents movement through solid world tiles
- Flight mode overrides gravity and enables direct vertical movement control

### World Generation and Management
- Infinite horizontal world expansion generates new columns on demand
- Vertical world expansion creates new terrain above and below existing boundaries  
- Terrain features include grass surface, soil layers, and stone depths
- Decorative elements like floating platforms and crystal formations provide visual interest
- Handcrafted spawn area ensures consistent initial player experience
- World state persists block modifications throughout gameplay session

### Block and Inventory System
- Five distinct block types with unique colors and properties
- Grid-based placement system aligns all blocks to consistent world coordinates
- Building radius limitation prevents placement beyond reasonable character reach
- Inventory selection maps to number keys 1-5 for quick access
